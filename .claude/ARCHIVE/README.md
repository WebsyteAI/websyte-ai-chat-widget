## 📋 Archive Structure

### Document Naming
Archived documents follow this pattern:
- `FEATURE-NAME-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Feature deprecated on date
- `PLANNING-HISTORY.md` - Consolidated planning history
- `MIGRATION-vX-to-vY.md` - Version migration guides

### Content Format
Each archived document includes:
- **Deprecation Date**: When it was archived
- **Replacement**: What replaced it (if applicable)
- **Reason**: Why it was deprecated
